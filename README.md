## Project Overview ##

This repository contains all the SQL scripts, database designs, and documentation for the "Next-Gen Restaurant Application" project, developed as part of INSC521. The project aims to design and implement a comprehensive database system for a futuristic restaurant application, focusing on efficient data handling, query optimization, and database management.

## Features ##

* **Entity-Relationship Diagrams:** These diagrams provide a visual representation of the database structure, illustrating the relationships between different data entities. They are crucial for understanding the overall architectural design of the database.

* **SQL Scripts:** This collection of scripts includes everything from table creation and data insertion to complex query executions. These scripts are optimized for performance and demonstrate advanced SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, and indexing.

* **Normalization Processes:** The documentation details the steps taken to normalize the database. This ensures minimal redundancy and improves data integrity, which is critical for efficient database management and query execution.


## Installation and Usage ##

**To use these scripts:**

Clone the repository.

Set up a SQL server (e.g., MySQL, Oracle).

Run the SQL scripts on your server.

## Learnings ##


The key learnings from this project include:

* **Database Design from SRS:** Learned how to interpret Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) and translate them into a comprehensive database design. This included understanding the necessary data entities, their attributes, and relationships.

* **Schema Implementation and Management:** Gained practical experience in implementing the designed schema in a SQL environment. This included creating tables, defining relationships, and ensuring data integrity through constraints and keys.

* **Advanced SQL Query Writing:** Developed skills in writing complex SQL queries, including those that involve multiple tables, aggregate functions, and nested queries. This enhanced my ability to extract meaningful information from large datasets.
